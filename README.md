# TextureCollider
C# classes for Unity3D for changing colors and textures of game objects

## TextureCollider.cs

This class can be attached to a gameObject in Unity. Once applied, the object will take the color and texture of any object it collides with.


## ToDos

- Make the transition from one color to the other progressive
- Mix different colors if colliding with multiple objects
- Take the image mapped to the colliding object and apply it

[ This is a work in progress ]
